# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Project

This project involves using various ensemble methods and decision trees to classify breast cancer data using scikit-learn. We'll be evaluating the performance of decision trees, bagging, AdaBoost, and random forests for this classification task.

Steps:
1) Load Data: Load the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn.
2) Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3) Model Building and Evaluation: Implement different classifiers:
Decision Tree
Bagging
AdaBoost
Random Forest
Evaluate each classifier's accuracy and visualize the results.
